ABSTRACT = {The development of agricultural robots is an increasingly popular research field aiming at addressing the widespread labor shortages in the farming industry and the ever-increasing food production demands. In many cases, multiple cooperating robots can be deployed in order to reduce task duration, perform an operation not possible with a single robot, or perform an operation more effectively. Building on previous results, this application paper deals with a cooperation strategy that allows two heterogeneous robots to cooperatively carry out grape harvesting, and its implementation is demonstrated. More specifically, the cooperative grape harvesting task involves two heterogeneous robots, where one robot (i.e., the expert) is assigned the grape harvesting task, whereas the second robot (i.e., the helper) is tasked with supporting the harvesting task by carrying the harvested grapes. The proposed cooperative harvesting methodology ensures safe and effective interactions between the robots. Field experiments have been conducted in order firstly to validate the effectiveness of the coordinated navigation algorithm and secondly to demonstrate the proposed cooperative harvesting method. The paper reports on the conclusions drawn from the field experiments, and recommendations for future enhancements are made. The potential of sophisticated as well as explainable decision-making based on logic for enhancing the cooperation of autonomous robots in agricultural applications is discussed in the context of mathematical lattice theory.},

ABSTRACT = {A gripper is the critical component of the robot end effector for the automatic harvesting of fruit, which determines whether the fruit can be harvested intact or undamaged. In this paper, a robotic gripper mechanism based on three-finger and variable-angle design is designed and analyzed for spherical or cylindrical fruit picking. Among the three fingers of the mechanical gripper, two fingers are rotatable through a pair of synchronous gears to ensure enough contact area for the grasping surfaces, which adapt to fruits of different sizes, such as cherry, loquat, zucchini, and so on. Furthermore, the mathematical relationship between gripper driving force and finger gripping force is obtained by the kinematic analysis of the gripper to realize stable grasping, and a grasping index is employed for the structural parameter optimization of our gripper. The grasping motion is analyzed, and the kinematic simulations are carried out, when the driving speeds of the gripper are 5 mm/s, 10 mm/s, and 15 mm/s, respectively. The system transfer function related to driving speed is obtained by curve fitting. Then, the grasping experiments are conducted with various spherical and cylindrical fruit, of which the weights are between 8 and 300 g and the diameters are from 9 to 122 mm. The experimental results demonstrate that our gripper has good kinematic performance and fruit adaptability. At the same time, the grasping is stable and reliable while no obvious damage appears on the fruit surface.},
